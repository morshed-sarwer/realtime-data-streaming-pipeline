# realtime-data-streaming-pipeline

**Introduction**

This project serves as a thorough roadmap for constructing a complete data engineering pipeline. It encompasses every phase, starting from data ingestion, progressing through processing, and concluding with storage. The implementation leverages a resilient technology stack, featuring Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. To ensure simplicity of deployment and scalability, all components are containerized using Docker.
